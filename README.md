# Secret Santa - by Lucas Kang
---
After being fed up of looking for a website or app that doesn't require personal information (name, e-mail, phone number, etc), I decided to build my own.

The objective of this project is to create a wesite in GitHub Pages that allows you to create a list of participants and then allow each of them to enter their name and see who they picked to gift.

Current state of the project:

* uses a pre-defined list
* allows input of name
* no working website
* no HTML
* no CSS
* no Python
* no Python framework
